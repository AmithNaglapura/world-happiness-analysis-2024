## 📌 Project Overview
What truly makes a country happy? This project explores the **2024 World Happiness Report** to identify the key drivers of global well-being. Using data from 143 countries, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and built supervised machine learning models to predict "Ladder Scores" based on economic and social factors.

## 📊 Key Insights & Visualizations
- **Correlation Mapping:** Identified the strongest links between GDP per capita, social support, and healthy life expectancy.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Implemented Linear Regression to quantify how much each factor contributes to a nation's happiness.
- **Visual Analytics:** Generated heatmaps and distribution plots to visualize the disparity between the happiest and least happy nations.
